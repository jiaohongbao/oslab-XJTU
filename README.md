# WARNING

This project is terminated in `2024/12/4`, but still has a problem here.

When we want to delete a folder that not empty, there should be a recursion to achieve this function, but due to deadline, I can't complete this program.

the temporary solution is to trash the judge segement, delete all, but it will case memory link.

If you are interested in this program, you can fork this repository, check-back to the commitment that without annotate that judgement, it is in the file: `3/src/command_line.c`, function of `void rmdir(char name[])`.

If you can fix this problem, you can commit it on github or other website, please tell me about you modification via: `jiaohongbao04@gmail.com`
